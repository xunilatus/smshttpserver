**Working 2024 nanohttpd-2.3.1 sms app** , THIS IS A START FOR YOU work in progress , "Only one-way sending is working atm". You have to manually enter the phone number "2224445555", im currently working on importing contacts and conversations from default apps, then actually making the upload and download buttons work

Imports (project view, or directory under AndroidStudioProjects>appName

there are youtube videos showing you how to import libraries in AndroidStudio, **'nanohttp-2.3.1.jar'** goes in 'libs' folder at "app-level". **'appName>app>libs'**. Make sure to righ-click on 'nanohttp-2.3.1' select **import as Library**

In the 'main' you should create an 'assets' folder so **'appName>app>src>main'** , the **index.html** js is there

I would cut copy paste or drag and drop renaming packages!
